I wish I was like NOUN, easily amused. Find my nest of NOUN. Everything's my fault. 
And NOUN could have it all, my empire of NOUN. I will let you down, I will make you VERB.
Why is the NOUN so ADJECTIVE, turned away from your side? Is my timing that ADJECTIVE, our NOUN run so dry?
I like big NOUN and I cannot lie. You other brother's can't VERB. When a NOUN walks in with a ADJECTIVE NOUN and a round thing in your face you get VERB. 
Just a ADJECTIVE town NOUN, VERB in a ADJECTIVE NOUN, she took the midnight NOUN going anywhere.
'Cause if you VERB it then you should have put a NOUN on it. 
When you VERB my name, it's like a little NOUN. I'm down on my NOUN, I wanna take you there.
My NOUN is killing me, I must confess I still VERB. When I'm not with you I lose my NOUN. Give me a NOUN, VERB me baby, one more time. 
I hear NOUN crying, I watch them VERB. They'll learn much more than I'll ever know. And I VERB to myself, what a ADJECTIVE world. 
You may think that I'm a VERB, but I'm not the only one. I hope someday you'll join us, and the NOUN will live as one.
